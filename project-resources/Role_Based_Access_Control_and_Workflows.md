## 1. End-to-End Workflow Definitions

### 1.1 Case Sheet Workflow

The Case Sheet is a central object in the system that involves multiple roles from inception to closure. The workflow must support both forward progression and backward transitions.
(TODO: India Team to visit the field and get clarifiations on the workflow!  Different modes of communication - medical camp? phone? in-person consultation?  What are all the different paths/ways a Case Sheet can be closed? Who is closing the case sheet? Under what conditions (exit criteria)?  

#### Actors Involved
- Paramedic
- Triage Nurse
- Nurse
- Doctor
- Referral Hospital / Specialist
- Administrator

#### Workflow States

1. **Created**
   - Case sheet is created by Paramedic or Nurse during initial patient encounter.
   - Basic patient details, symptoms, vitals, and preliminary observations are recorded.

2. **Triage**
   - Triage Nurse reviews the case.
   - Priority level assigned.
   - May add additional vitals and notes.
   - Can send back to *Created* state for corrections or missing information.

3. **Clinical Review**
   - Nurse performs detailed assessment.
   - Updates treatment notes, medications, and care plan.
   - Can move forward to Doctor Review or send back to Triage.

4. **Doctor Review**
   - Doctor evaluates the case.
   - Adds diagnosis, prescriptions, and recommendations.
   - May:
     - Approve treatment and close the case.
     - Refer to hospital/specialist.
     - Send back to Nurse or Triage for more details.

5. **Referral (Optional)**
   - Case is referred to hospital or specialist.
   - Referral details, documents, and follow-ups are attached.
   - Status updated based on hospital feedback.

6. **Closure**
   - Case is closed after successful treatment or referral completion.
   - Final diagnosis and outcomes recorded.
   - Case becomes read-only.

#### Assets (Educational Videos)
- Upload → Review → Approve → Publish → Archive

#### Events (Health Camps)
- Draft → Review → Approve → Publish → Execute → Report → Archive

#### Feedback & Messages
- Submit → Review → Respond → Close

## Role-Based Access Mapping (RBAC)

### Roles

- SUPER_ADMIN  
- ADMIN  
- DOCTOR  
- TRIAGE_NURSE  
- NURSE  
- PARAMEDIC  
- GRIEVANCE_OFFICER

- DATA_ENTRY_OPERATOR  

### Managed Objects

- Assets (Educational Videos)
- Case Sheets
- Events
- Patient Data
- Users
- Patient Feedback
- Messages
- Tasks (TODO lists)

### Access Levels

- N = No Access  
- R = Read Only  
- RW = Read and Write

## 3. Summary

This document defines:
- End-to-end operational workflows.
- Detailed role-based access mapping.

This will serve as a baseline for system design, development, and QA validation.

##4. Later TBD

- Medical Disclaimers, NDAs etc.
- Any other legal procedures/documents
